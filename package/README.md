# TinyWidgets

A collection of tiny, reusable, UI components
â€” wrapped in a helpful app layout with header, side bar, dark mode, and more.

See the [website](https://tinywidgets.org/) for more details.

TinyWidgets uses React for DOM manipulation, Vanilla-Extract for styling and theming, Lucide for icons, and TinyBase for state management. Its philosophy is all about simplicity, decent defaults, a streamlined DOM, and concise styling.

But, just to be clear - that doesn't mean you need to use Vanilla-Extract, Lucide, or Tinybase in the apps you build with these widgets. You can set arbitrary class names (from Tailwind, for example!) on all components if you like.

Of course, this site is itself a demo of TinyWidgets, showing off the components and layout in action. But check out the individual components by navigating the API documentation in the side bar.
